I've always wanted to make this ancient recipe of mine. It's a bit long, but here goes:

This tasty kung pao chicken is similar to what is served in Chinese restaurants. It's easy to make, and you can be as creative with the measurements as you want. You can't go wrong! The sauce reduces until nice and thick.

How to Make Kung Pao Chicken
You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect when you make this top-rated Kung Pao chicken:

1. Make the marinade, then marinate chicken in the fridge.
2. Make the chili paste-brown sugar sauce. Add the remaining ingredients and cook.
3. Cook the marinated chicken in a skillet until it's cooked through.
4. Add the chicken to the chili paste-brown sugar sauce.
5. Continue cooking until the sauce thickens.

Ingredients
* 2 tablespoons cornstarch, dissolved in 2 tablespoons water
* 2 tablespoons white wine, divided
* 2 tablespoons soy sauce, divided
* 2 tablespoons sesame oil, divided
* 1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into chunks
* 1 ounce hot chili paste
* 2 teaspoons brown sugar
* 1 teaspoon distilled white vinegar
* 1 (8 ounce) can water chestnuts
* 4 ounces chopped peanuts

* 1 tablespoon chopped garlic

Directions:
1. Combine water and cornstarch in a cup; set aside.
2. Combine 1 tablespoon wine, 1 tablespoon soy sauce, 1 tablespoon sesame oil, and 1 tablespoon cornstarch/water mixture in a large glass bowl. Add chicken pieces and toss to coat. Cover the dish and refrigerate for about 30 minutes.
3. Combine remaining 1 tablespoon wine, 1 tablespoon soy sauce, 1 tablespoon sesame oil, and remaining cornstarch/water mixture in a medium bowl. Whisk in chili paste, brown sugar, and vinegar. Add water chestnuts, peanuts, green onions, and garlic and toss to coat.
4. Transfer water chestnut mixture to a medium skillet. Heat slowly over medium heat until aromatic.
